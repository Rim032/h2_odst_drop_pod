**[RPT] Rim's Player Tagging**

[----Purpose----]

This mod for GMOD provides normal players and roleplayers to drop into any map with a halo ODST drop pod. You can drop in beaches, towns, cities and etc.

[----Reason----]

Wanted to release something for GMOD's halo community and make a driveable/flyable entity without relying on previously user-made bases/libraries.

[---Misc.---]

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know.
